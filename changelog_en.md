Romans:
- Shield now only protects 15 targets for 30 seconds.
- Medics now only heal 8 / 12 / 16 HP per heal.
- The outline of the small temple has been made more precise, so it now no longer blocks some squares that were not actually occupied by the building. This also makes it minimally faster to level.

Vikings:
- The small tower now costs only 3/1.
- The large tower now costs only 7/4.
- The castle now costs only 12/6.
- The outline of the small temple has been made more precise. As a result, it is also leveled a bit faster, but most importantly, it is no longer quite as bulky to place.
- The forester now only pauses 3 seconds between operations instead of 5.

Mayas:
- The large tower now no longer blocks space for its entire upper floor, but in a similar frame to its similarly built Viking counterpart. This also makes it level faster.
- The conversion spell now only costs 14->56 mana.
- The HGHG start gets his 8th axe back (as with Classic Balancing).

Trojan:
- The bakery now only costs 6/3 instead of 6/4.

### Added
- S3: Adds some unit control settings to improve usability when switching between games.
```
This setting is interesting for players who mainly play Settlers IV and only play Settlers III from time to time. It changes the unit control so that it works similarly to the control used in Settlers IV. For example, the behavior of 'CTRL' and 'ALT' is swapped when sending units, and specialists start working at the destination point if they were sent without 'ALT'.
```

```
Adjustments to Roman combat spells:
Shield spell now lasts only 40 seconds instead of 60 seconds. Also, shield spell now affects 20 targets again (as in 2.9.0) instead of 16.

```
Each nation gets the same random races. For example, both teams have 2 Romans, 1 Mayan, or both teams have 3 Vikings.

If the teams are set so that there are no equal positions in the opposing team, this feature is not supported.
